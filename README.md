# pyBART

The [balloon analogue risk task (BART)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulsivity#Balloon_Analogue_Risk_Task) is designed to assess risk-taking behavior. Here I provide a python implementation of the BART.

## Usage

This repository contains a configuration file `cfg` and python script `BART.py` to test participants.

`git clone https://github.com/davidnsousa/pyBART.git`

Open the configuration file with a common text editor. The BART setup can be specified here.

Run `BART.py` with python 3.

Upon the BART completion an output `.csv` file is generated in the same directory with the same name as the code specified in the participant's Id input field: test.csv as default.
